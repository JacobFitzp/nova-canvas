### What is it?

I'm attempting to build the ultimate WYSIWYG editor for Laravel Nova, built on top of Tiptap.

My aim is to create something that feels like it's part of Nova out of the box, even replicating its styling and design patterns.

### Objectives for MVP

- Basic text formatting (headings, bold, italic, strikethrough etc...)
- Image uploads
- Image manipulation (resize, move, rotate etc...)
- Tables
- Lists
- Links

### When will it be ready?

I'm not trying to rush things, and have to fit this in around other projects. I expect to have a stable release towards the end of the year.
